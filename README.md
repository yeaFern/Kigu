Kigu is a 2D OpenGL engine which is aiming to be easy to use for both small and large projects.

It will provide abstractions of low level graphics and audio APIs and allow the user to get right down to the specifics of their application.

# Getting Started
Kigu requires a C++17 compliant compiler, currently only VS2017 has been tested.

Simply `git clone https://github.com/yeaFern/Kigu.git` and run [premake](https://premake.github.io/) to generate project files for your system.
